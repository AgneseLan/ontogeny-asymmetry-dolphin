## Data :floppy_disk: 

The data are provided in the Data folder. Mesh files (PLY) needed to test postioning when importing landmarks are available at Phenome10k (https://www.phenome10k.org/). 
Zipped data need to be extracted before use.

- __Landmark data__: *pts folder* <br />
Text files with landmark coordinates for each specimen in PTS format. 

- __Surface data__: *ply folder* <br />
Empty folder where mesh files from Phenome10k need to be saved to reproduce the code.

- __Specimens' classifiers, landmark/curves lists__: *absent_curves.csv, absent_LMs.csv, curves.csv, landpairs_LM.csv, LMs.csv, specimens.csv* <br />
Spreadsheets with additional inforation for analyses: list of absent landmarks and curves, list of curves, list of landmark pairs, list of landmakrs, classifiers for specimens (ID, genera, family, growth stage, Age, length, bizygomatic width).

- __Phylogentic tree__: *tree_odontonly.txt* <br />
Tree with branch lenghts for the taxa used in the analyses in Nexus format. Branch lenghts and topology from McGowen et al. 2020

- __Surface data__: *ply folder* <br />
Empty folder where mesh files from Phenome10k need to be saved to reproduce the code.

- __Silhouettes of taxa and groups for plots__: *b.bona.png, b.physalus.png, phocoena.png, stenella.png*

## Analysis :computer:
In this repository you will find raw data (.csv and data files) and code for analyses (code supplied as .R files)

üìÅ Data

As described above. Raw shape data files and GPSA results available on Dryad (https://datadryad.org/stash/share/P6YMy3QspoUdNIIyy5A9DV5ojdryerS1Bb1GlRO4uwE - https://doi.org/10.6086/D1R69C).

üìÅ Code for analyses

*ossification_size_allometry_analyses.R, tympanic_bulla_shape_analyses.R, periotic_shape_analyses.R*

Before running analyses, save Data folder in the same directory as the R project. This will allow to import the data as detailed in the code provided.
